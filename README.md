## User Story

As a freelance web developer, I want to generate a simple logo for my projects so that I don't have to pay a graphic designer.

## Acceptance Criteria

To meet the requirements of this challenge, the command-line application must:

- Prompt the user for text (up to three characters).
- Allow the user to input text color using a color keyword or a hexadecimal number.
- Present the user with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square.
- Accept the user's input for the shape's color using a color keyword or a hexadecimal number.
- Create an SVG file named `logo.svg` after the user has provided input for all prompts.
- Print the output text "Generated logo.svg" in the command line.
- When the user opens the `logo.svg` file in a browser, it should display a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria entered.

## Usage
Follow the prompts to enter your logo details:

- Logo Text (up to three characters)
- Text Color (color keyword or hexadecimal number)
- Choose a Shape (circle, triangle, or square)
- Shape Color (color keyword or hexadecimal number)
